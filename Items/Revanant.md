> "So you fucked up. You read a scroll you really shouldn't have despite its warning in giant (oh wait you can't read that). Welcome back to the land of the living. Things have changed a bit."

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

In this campaign, a revenant is of near legendary status. Only really high level magic users or some clerics will know of them. Even then, they are feared.

**Bonuses**:
- Immunity to poison
- Relentless: If you are below half your hp and are not damaged further by either radiant or fire damage you will regain 1 hp per turn. This continues even if you reach zero HP. However, if you are killed by either radiant or fire damage you still do not die, but rather you will awake in a random body (remembering everything) within a 1 mile radius.

**Changes**: You loose your current racial and skills traits and gain an Ability Score Increase trait to the following: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 

**Craving**: You crave life force, if you are injured you feel a desire to feed on a living creature to rejuvenate yourself. If you feed you will gain **1d4 HP** back, but you will do 1d8 worth of damage to the creature. You cannot feed on yourself.

**Frenzy**: Not feeding has consequences. If you do not feed after a long rest, you will need to make a CON saving throw. This will increase in difficulty over time. If you resist to many times, you will break and will brutally kill whoever or whatever is in your path until you are satisfied (or at the DMs discretion).

Unknown: There are other benefits and drawbacks that will be revealed later.
