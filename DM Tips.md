First you need to understand what sort of structure or dungeon you are trying to describe. A Temple is not going to contain the same rooms as a Wizard's Tower. Second begin by describing using this criteria :

1- Dimension of the room.
2- Light and Light sources.
3- Visible Doors and Exits. ( Including stairs ).
4- Major Structures or Features. ( Pillars, Dias, Pedestals, Statues,  Pit, Chasm, Stream, Lava ).
5- Furniture. ( Tables, Chairs, Cabinets, Torture Implements )
If you want to go further 
6- Temperature.
7- Sounds ( Dripping water, Hissing Fire, Moans or cries, Laughter, People Talking ) Smell ( Rotten Flesh, Perfume Aroma, Cooked Meat, Baked Bread ).

After you describe all that start by describing the living creatures inside the room ( Humanoids, Lizardmen, Dogs, Minatour, Dragon ).

Here is a sample :

You enter a circular chamber of 50 by 50 feet in diameter and 30 feet high separated in two floors. Large torches light up the whole area, above, you see a bridge extending from the upper floor from your left side to the right side held by multiple pillars. ahead of you at the end of the chamber you see an open large double door with stairs leading upward. Shallow water covers the entire floor of the area you are standing on and you can hear water dripping from the ceiling, The floor is uneven and is hard to move but the water isn't deep and barely covers the soles of your foot. You see different types of small algae and plants sprouting out from the floor and small fish swimming about. The area is cold as your body starts to shiver and you see the breath vapors coming out of your mouth.  
  
After they move around and inspect. You can say :

Fish like monsters stand on their feet and point their tridents towards you! roll for initiative.

Hope this helps.
