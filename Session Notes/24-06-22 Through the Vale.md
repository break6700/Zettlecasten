# Last Time
You as the Party have employed to do a job by an eccentric man calling himself Corvax, who just appeared to you during a moment when you were all far from sober. He said something about a destiny or something like that and that you should come to precise co-ordinates, pass through the Vale and defeat whatever evil that was tainting his land. In your drunkened state you agreed, and after you all went to sleep, and awoke the next day, you all found that you had faint tattoos across your wrist that wasn't there the night before.

After speaking to someone at a temple, it was revealed that you had accidentally made an unbreakable vow to go on this journey and complete this quest. That is why begrudgingly you find your way to the place you were supposed to meet. Making your way closer to the Vale, you look up in awe at the great magical barrier separating the land. A constant thrum of magic, along with great black swirling mists of particles moving as though they had a life of their own, stands before you seeming stretching infinitely each direction. The evening is warm and pleasant, the sun kissing your backs as you stand at an otherwise unassuming stretch of the road. Then you watch as the Vale before you distorts and a great booming voice comes out. "Come forth adventures. Come forth and save our land from the terrors we face". You feel yourself compelled to walk forward into the Vale. Your initiatives tell you no, but your body betrays you, and you inch closer. You watch as suddenly the part of the Vale in front of you goes a translucent white, and you can make out two figures on tall and one short beckoning you through. You move closer still, and you can make up the room they are standing in (dark and candle lit). Your body takes one more step, the magic of the Vale causing a wave of heat and coldness at the sometime to rush over you. Then you are through, but not at the place you saw, instead you feel rain on your face and your feet are swallowed in mud.  You are standing on a track, not dissimilar to the one you had been previously on. Looking around, the trees on either side of you have been uprooted and the rest of the forest you appear to be in is dead and barren. The sky is dark with thunderclouds above your head and rain gets harder. Looking back at the Vale, you can see the two figures, looking down at something. One of them slams a book shut and sits down with hands on their face, distraught. "Shit" you hear from the Vale and just as it opened, the doorway you stepped through closes, until there was no evidence of it ever being there.
