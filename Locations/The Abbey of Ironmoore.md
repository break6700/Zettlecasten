#location 

Located near the small village of Ironmoore.

A fortified abbey located on rocky cliffs over looking the see of the border of two empires.

The Abbey is run by warrior monks

Large stone stucture

Surrounded by a Leomundâ€™s Tiny Hut spell emitting a faintly glowing golden bubble around the abbey

Long winding cobbled road leads up the cliffs towards abbey.

Looming dark stone buttresses giving a the abbey an other worldly appearance. 

A perfect defensible position

The Abbey houses one of the largest libraries in the world, in the mines below the fortress. The mines were once a dwarven emerald mine.
